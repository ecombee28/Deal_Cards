# Deal_Cards
A web program that deals, shuffle, reorders, and discards playing cards. This program uses Javascript to exacute the operations of the program, while HTML and CSS is used for styling.
# How to Use
To start the program run the ManageCards.html file in your browser. I have supplied images of all 52 cards in a deck.


- **Deal Cards** To deal the cards you simple click on the image of the deck of cards. Once you have reach the end of the cards
you will no longer be able to deal more cards.
- **Shuffle Cards** To shuffle cards click on the shuffle cards button. When you shuffle the cards the card's in the discard pile will be shuffled as well.
- **Discard cards** To discard cards you simple click and drag the desired card that you wish to discard over to the discard pile.
- **Cut the Deck** To cut the deck you select the cut deck button. Once it is selected you will be asked were in the deck do you want to cut the deck at. Once you selected the place you want to cut the deck the bottom half will be placed on top of the top half.
- **Order Cards** When the cards are first delt they are in order if you choose to reorder the deck after it has been shuffled or delt, simply select the oreder deck button.
- **Rebuild Deck** This button simple restartes the program over again.
